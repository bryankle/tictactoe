Application created on February 21, 2017.
README written on June 5, 2017

This application was created as part of the FreeCodeCamp curriculum under the "Advanced Front End Development Projects" (https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-tic-tac-toe-game).

User stories:
	- I can play a game of Tic Tac Toe with the computer
	- My game will reset as soon as it's over so I can play again
	- I can choose whether I want to play as X or O

Additional features included
	- Unbeatable AI using Minimax algorithm

Code Notes: I created this tic-tac-toe application almost entirely in vanilla javascript in effort to gain a better understanding of pure javascript. On the animation side, I used jQuery. I also made an effort to keep my code as organized as I could. At this point, I did not yet have a true grasp on object oriented programming, however, I tried my best to keep my functions and variables sorted in a logical fashion. The collections of variables and functions were organized to follow the flow of the application, from player, shape selection, the logic of the game, until the end where a winner is declared and board is reset. If I were to remake this application today, I'd make most of my changes to the structure and organization of the code. Now that I have a comfortable grasp of the word 'this', along with prototyping and inheritance, I'd approach this with an OOP structure and treat each new game as an instance while keeping all of the underlying logic inside of the primarily object of the game. 

Personal Notes: This was definitely one of my most challenging projects to date, especially in the implementation of the Minimax algorithm. The 2 player implementation was done in under a day, but I realized that the true challenge of programming resided in the implementation of an unbeatable AI, so I resigned myself to doing everything I could until the AI couldn't be beaten. This process took a few days of constant effort, including researching minimax, testing, and studying other existing implementations in C++, but as soon as I made the final edit, tabbed over to my browser and hit CTRL+R for at least hundredth time at this point, I started testing the game with the AI and performed it flawlessly! Completing this project has definitely been my largest milestone to date. This was the first time I initially thought of a project as 'impossible' for my skill level, but the feeling of impossibility began to dissapear as I progressed deeper into the project. Now, when I take on a new project that I haven't had the slightest clue of where to begin, I remember this project, and begin working away until the feeling dissapears.
